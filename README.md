# term plan
term plan 
a website to plan your term and check how many units of each table you have to pass to graduate 
until now we implement this only for the Amirkabir university of technology student soon we will have other universities in our list.
we see that each term most students puts lots of time for planning their next semester and checking charts so we decide to implement this app to 
reduce the time needed for these kinds of works.
we use Django for backend and CSS and Js for frontend 
you can check the requirement.txt to check what you need to have to run the project properly.
this project implemented by Parnian Taghipour, Mahsa Dibaji, Behrad Khorramnazari, and Nika Shahabi for software development course thought by Dr.Amin Gheybi
