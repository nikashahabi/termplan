# term plan
term plan 
a website to plan your semester and check how many units of each table you have to pass to graduate.
until now we implement this only for Amirkabir university of technology student soon we will have other universities in our list.
we see that each term most students put a lot of time for planning their next semester and checking charts so we decide to implement this app to 
reduce the time needed for these kinds of works.
we use Django for backend and HTML, CSS and JS for frontend. 
you can check the requirement.txt to see what you need to have to run the project properly.
this project is implemented by Parnian Taghipour, Mahsa Dibaji, Behrad Khorramnazari, and Nika Shahabi for software development course thought by Dr.Amin Gheybi
